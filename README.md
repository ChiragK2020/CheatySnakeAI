# CheatySnakeAI
A Snake AI that follows the hamiltonian cycle(apology if the spelling is wrong)

I have a lovely Purple snake that follows the same path over and over to occupy all spaces on the board.
I have used p5.js libraries and some weird Math
I feel proud about it and this is just some early projects :D

CODE DESCRIPTION:

Snake class with direction,few functions a long show function with multiple fors and ifs..
A parts array that is just bunch of vectors ..I store the entire path  of snake in xs[] and ys[]..the different parts are just teleported and stuff..
Thank You..Enjoy sitting for hours to let the snake grow .
